            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound large raw shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chopped plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh mint, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup crispy fried onions or shallots, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place rice in a large bowl, and cover with cold running water. Agitate with hands to release excess starch, and pour off water.</li> 
            <li>Repeat process until water is mostly clear, 4 to 5 times.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the ghee in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon garam masala, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon each of grated garlic and ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon coriander.</li> 
            <li>Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li> 
            <li>Add rice, and cook, stirring constantly, until rice is well coated in ghee and spices, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 2 1/4 cups water, and stir. Bring to a boil over high heat.</li> 
            <li>Stir, and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li> 
            <li>Simmer, undisturbed, until rice is just tender, about 12 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Remove from heat, and remove lid. Fluff with a fork, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk together yogurt, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon garam masala, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li> 
            <li>Add shrimp, and toss to fully coat; set aside.</li> 
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>  
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or large oven-safe nonstick saucepan.</li> 
            <li>Add onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 4 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Add tomatoes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to release liquid and soften, about 3 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Add 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, remaining 2 teaspoons garam masala, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, remaining 1 teaspoon each garlic and ginger, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon coriander.</li> 
            <li>Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li> 
            <li>Reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have mostly broken down and mixture resembles a tomato sauce in texture, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, and add shrimp mixture, stirring constantly, until well combined.</li> 
            <li>Stir in 1/4 cup cilantro and 1 tablespoon mint.</li>
            <li>Remove half (about 1 heaping cup) of the shrimp mixture from Dutch oven, and set aside in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Spread remaining shrimp mixture in the Dutch oven into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Add half (about 3 cups) of cooked rice mixture over shrimp mixture.</li>
            <li>Add reserved 1 heaping cup shrimp mixture over rice.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cilantro and 1/2 tablespoon mint.</li>
            <li>Add remaining rice mixture over shrimp mixture, and spread into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons ghee in a small bowl, and stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon turmeric.</li>
            <li>Drizzle over rice mixture. Place a lid on Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp finishes cooking, 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, and remove lid. Shrimp will be bright pink outside and meat will be opaque,.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro and 1/2 tablespoon mint.</li>
            <li>Top with fried onions and drizzle with melted ghee, as desired. Serve immediately.</li>    
        </ol>
